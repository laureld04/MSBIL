    "## **Importing and Correcting Data**\n",
    "#### 1. Type the following command in your terminal to read information and options available: **ImportBruker** (need image)\n",
    "#### 2. Type the following command to import your blip_up & blip_down data: (need image)\n",
    "* What is the c for?\n",
    "* Blip up is the forward phase encoding of a scan while blip down is the same exact scan but with reversed phase encoding. You may not always will have both blip up and blip down, but for the purpose of this protocol both will be shown.\n",
    "* Sometimes your blip up and blip down data will be split across four scans (two blip up scans and two blip down scans). If that is the case, simply make a new folders and move the all the blip up raw data into one folder, rename the first blip up raw folder as 01, and the second as 02. Do the same for the blip down data. In other words you should have two folders (one for blip up and down) each with two sub-folders labeled as 01 and 02 corresponding to their scan order. For the ImportBruker command, you only need to input UP to the blip up/down folder containing the subfolders for the path.\n",
    "* If you want to control where InputBruker puts the output proc folder, use -o with the desired directory.\n",
    "#### 3. Change directories to the containers: **cd /rsgrps/hutchinsone/Singularity_Containers**\n",
    "#### 4. Load the singularity containers: **module load singularity** followed by **singularity run nklab-neurotools-v0.4.sif**\n",
    "* You should be able to see the entire contents of the container.\n",
    "#### 5. Type the following command to start up itksnap for visualizing your images: **singularity run nklab-neurotools-v0.4.sif itksnap**\n",
    "* Pay close attention to orientation, if you plan on utilizing a corrected and centered structural image, it is important to also orient the original images in the same directions for the later DRBUDDI step. Please refer to **reorient image** section.\n",
    "#### 6. Check the reoriented image to make sure the origin for both the blip up and blip down image matches.\n",
    "* Without this, the images may not be able to be combined in the DRBUDDI step and will error out. \n",
    "* Please refer to **change origin** section.\n",
    "#### 7. If the origins match or have been modified to now match, confirm you have a folder set up for the settings files. \n",
    "* Settings folder named **DIFF_PREP_WORK that contains the file that will be used in the DIFFPREP command is required.\n",
    "* Please refer to **DIFF_PREP_WORK Setup** section.\n",
    "#### 8. Type the following command in your terminal: DIFFPREP -i \"your_blip_up_reoriented\".list --reg_settings \"your_settings_file\".dmc \n",
    "* You will run this command twice, once for blip down image, and a second for the blip up image. Repeat depending on how many sets of blip up and down images you have."
