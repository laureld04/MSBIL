After this threshold, your tissue sample is suceptible to unwanted growth that could be damaging.\n"

    "#### 1. Under a chemical hood, plug in your weight scale and set you tube of 15 mL DI water, Sodium Azide stock powder, and tongue depressor.\n",
    "#### 2. Make sure your face mask and goggles/glasses are proprely fitted to your face.\n",
    "    * Small traces of Sodium Azide in dry powder form can be highly toxic. \n",
    "#### 3. Once your area is setup, turn your weight scale on.\n",
    "#### 4. Set a empty weight boat on the scale and zero the scale.\n",
    "#### 5. Remove the cap from the sodium azide stock powder bottle.\n",
    "#### 6. Using the wooden tongue depressor, slowly pour a small amount of sodium azide onto the tongue depressor and pour it into the weigh boat.\n",
    "    * Be careful not to pour too quickly to cause powder from going into the air.\n",
    "    * Take your time on this step and continually check the scale reading to prevent adding too much powder.\n",
    "    * If for some reason some powder spills, dampen a paper towel and wipe up excess and immediately throw out the paper towel (make sure no particles from the paper towels fall as you move it to the trash). This is in instances where **small amounts** of powder falls. If the amounts are much larger, immediately seek out a lab employee as it may require more clean-up capability.\n",
    "#### 7. After you have the correct amount, close the cap of the sodium azide stock powder bottle and set aside.\n",
    "#### 8. Open the 15 mL tube of DI water.\n",
    "#### 9. Carefully create a crease on the weight boat (try not to aggravate the powder with large movements) and slowly pour powder into the 15 mL tube.\n",
    "#### 10. Close the tube and mark the tube with chemical and concentration information, date, and initials.\n",
    "#### 11. Clean space up and take all equipment used with you, disposing of any material used in the trash. \n",
    "#### 12. Either shake 15 mL mixture or place on a vortex mixer for a couple of seconds. \n",
    "    **NOTE: DO NOT DISPOSE OF SODIUM AZIDE IN SOLUTION (in liquid) DOWN THE DRAIN!**\n",
