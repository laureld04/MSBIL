    "* **You cannot run the simulation while a scan is actively running.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A common practice is to calculate resolution that you want to obtain. Below is a quick equation to help facilitate this for those of us who cannot do mental math...\n",
    " $$ Resolution = \\frac{FOV}{Image Size} $$\n",
    "* This is usually carried out in the **Geometry** tab of the currently open scan in your examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ernst Angle equation also comes in handy when running T1 MDEFT, T1 FLASH scans. Below is a quick equation to help.\n",
    "![image](Ernst_Angle.png)\n",
    "* You will need to assume your T1 of the tissue you are interested in.\n"
