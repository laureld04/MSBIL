This includes general documents and details of what we do in the lab along with all of the tools we utilize for visualizing and processing data.

Still in the process of being updated.

Includes singularity container recipe files for storage and keeping track of updates made for usage on high performance computing resources for the University of Arizona.
Below is the current list of the different containers we house on the HPC:
- DeepLabCut (DLC) GUI: deeplabcut.sif (made from deeplabcut.recipe) - used for animal tracking of behavior and is created by this group: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut
        - DLC has been adapted to work on the UofA HPC for research purposes in the lab.
